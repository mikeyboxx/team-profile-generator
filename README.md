# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that generates a webpage that displays team's basic information, offering quick access to team member's emails and GitHub profiles. The HTML file is nicely formatted reflecting the team roster based on user input, and is saved on the user's machine.

The user is first prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, email address, and office number. Then he is presented with a menu of options to add an engineer, intern or to finish building the team. Once he selects an option to add another user, he is prompted to enter the new member's name, email, and GitHub username or School name. Once he is finished with adding team memebers, the HTML is generated, and stats are produced and displayed in the console.  The HTML file gets written to the /dist/ directory.
